# If you want to store images yourself, please read this guidelines:
# For users, if you only use this theme, put your images directly in `source/assets/images` folder
# But if you want to add local images, you can put your images directly in `source/assets/images` folder
# For developpers, if you modify this theme, put your images in `source/images` folder and
# use grunt task `build` to synchronize assets
