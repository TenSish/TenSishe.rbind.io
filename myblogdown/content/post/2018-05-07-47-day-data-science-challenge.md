 “The Journey of a thousand miles begin with one step” 
                                               - Lao Tzu 


*Yay, I finally started a blog!*


My name is **Tenzin Sishe**, and I am an aspiring Data Scientist. My interests include Data Science, technology, traveling, photography, meditation, philosophy, cooking, sci-fi movies/shows and the list goes on. I graduated with B.A in Psychology and a minor in Gen-Science. Coming from a psychology background, I’ve learned to appreciate the value of data and how it can be utilized to benefit our society. Right now, I am working towards completing my Data Science course and hopefully find a career in Data Science. 



I am very excited to share this journey with you. I have decided to start this 47-day data science challenge mainly because I want to finish my online data science course in 47 days. It is my way of motivating and keeping myself accountable. My goal is to post three to four blogs per week on different machine learning concepts that I will be learning throughout the challenge. I will also be posting all the resources that I will be using to learn the concepts. I am open to constructive criticism, so please feel free leave suggestions or feedbacks.
